# GmailSpammer

A simple Gmail spammer created using Flask. This tool is for educational purposes only.

I noticed many existing spam tools ask you to input your password, which is not possible if you have two-factor authentication enabled. It is also less secure that other methods. Thatâ€™s why I created my own Gmail Spammer. This way, you can test email automation safely without compromising your security.

## How to Use:
1. Download the project files.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   flask run
